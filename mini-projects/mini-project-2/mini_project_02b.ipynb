    "Description: This program trains a deep Q-network (DQN) to optimize inventory management in a simulated environment, handling raw material and product stocks, cash flow, and variable demand. The agent learns an effective policy using experience replay, target networks, and reward normalization, achieving improved cash performance while mitigating challenges from stockout penalties.\n",

    "1. One of the primary challenges I encountered was managing the large negative reward values caused by stockout penalties. These penalties not only caused instability in the DQN, often leading to exploding gradients, but also shifted the agent’s focus almost entirely toward avoiding stockouts, at the expense of learning other beneficial actions. To address this, I applied gradient clipping and reward normalization to keep training stable and to ensure that the reward signal remained informative. During troubleshooting, I also implemented extensive logging to monitor the model’s behavior throughout training. This experience emphasized the importance of observing the neural network’s loss trends, as waiting solely for increases in cumulative reward is impractical for slow converging models. One question I still have is how to determine whether the model has converged to a local minimum rather than the optimal policy. In a real-world deployment, would it be advantageous to maintain a prolonged exploration period to ensure sufficient coverage of the state space?\n",
    "2. Overall, the model performed reasonably well, achieving approximately a 10% increase in cash over 50 steps.\n",
    "3. Reinforcement learning offers several advantages over traditional control methods, and control plays a central role across many industries. In agriculture in particular, RL has the potential to significantly improve system performance. Biological processes are often highly non-linear and influenced by numerous interacting variables, which makes them difficult to manage using traditional PID controllers that rely on linear assumptions. RL, by contrast, is inherently well-suited for non-linear and dynamic environments, enabling it to adapt control policies based on feedback and changing conditions. Furthermore, within the broader context of AI development, RL is considered a key component in progressing toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike large language models, which are stateless and limited to the distribution of data on which they were trained, RL agents actively interact with and explore their environments. This ability allows RL systems to discover new states and behaviors beyond their initial training data, and often at a lower computational cost than retraining or scaling static models. As a result, RL represents a promising path toward building systems that can operate flexibly in open-ended, real-world environments.\n",
